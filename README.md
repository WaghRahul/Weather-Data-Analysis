# Weather Data Analysis

**Overview:**
Developed a machine learning model to classify weather descriptions using a Random Forest Classifier. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation to achieve high accuracy in weather description prediction.

**Key Steps:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Renamed columns, handled null values and duplicates, and standardized weather descriptions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Generated summary statistics, visualizations (line plots, histograms, heatmaps), and correlation analysis.
- **Outlier Handling:** Created boxplots, and removed outliers using the interquartile range method.
- **Data Balancing:** Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the target variable.
- **Model Building:** Developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict weather types based on variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed accuracy (~91%) using confusion matrix and classification report.

**Skills Used:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Model Evaluation

**Conclusion:**
The Random Forest model effectively classifies weather descriptions, demonstrating the application of data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning in weather data analysis.
